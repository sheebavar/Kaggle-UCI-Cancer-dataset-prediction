OBJECTIVE:-

The goal of this project is to classify breast cancer tumors into malignant or benign groups using the provided database and machine learning skills. In other words, we try to predict the probability of a tumor being benign based on the historical data (feature and target variables) that are already synthesized. 
The data for this study is a modified version of a dataset that is collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository [1]. In the current version of the data, all values are synthesized, and they are not real-valued features. The only purpose of this dataset is to test the machine learning skills of the applicants. 

ATTRIBUTES:-

Attribute Information: 1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32) 

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: 
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) i) symmetry j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
